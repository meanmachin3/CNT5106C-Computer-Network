\begin{homeworkProblem}
\begin{homeworkSection}{(a)}
A user requests a Web page that consists of some text and three images. For this page, the client will send one request message and receive four response messages \\
\problemAnswer{
    False. Only Single response would be received.
}
\end{homeworkSection}
\begin{homeworkSection}{(b)}
Two distinct Web pages (for example, www.mit.edu/research.html and
www.mit.edu/students.html) can be sent over the same persistent connection. \\
\problemAnswer{
True. With persistent connections, the server leaves the TCP connection open after sending responses and hence the subsequent requests and responses between the same client and server can be sent. 
}
\end{homeworkSection}

\begin{homeworkSection}{(c)}
With nonpersistent connections between browser and origin server, it is possible for a single TCP segment to carry two distinct HTTP request messages. \\
\problemAnswer{
False. A single TCP segment can carry only single request/response.
}
\end{homeworkSection}


\begin{homeworkSection}{(d)}
The \texttt{Date: header} in the HTTP response message indicates when the object in the response was last modified.\\
\problemAnswer{
False. The date and time at which the message was originated (in "HTTP-date" format as defined by RFC 7231 Date/Time Formats).
}
\end{homeworkSection}


\begin{homeworkSection}{(e)}
HTTP response messages never have an empty message body.\\
\problemAnswer{
False.  Not all responses have one: responses with a status code that sufficiently answers the request without the need for corresponding payload (like 201 Created or 204 No Content) usually don't.
}
\end{homeworkSection}
\end{homeworkProblem}

\begin{homeworkProblem}
\begin{homeworkSection}{}
Consider an HTTP client that wants to retrieve a Web document at a given URL. The IP address of the HTTP server is initially unknown. What transport and application-layer protocols besides HTTP are needed in this scenario \\
\problemAnswer{
   In order to receive a web document from a given URL, its IP address needs to be resolved. This is done using DNS. Once the URL is resolved a subsequent request is made to fetch Web document.\\
   \textbf{Transport Layer Protocol Used: } UDP(DNS) and TCP (HTTP) \\
   \textbf{Application Layer Protocol Used:} DNS and HTTP \\
}
\end{homeworkSection}

\end{homeworkProblem}

\begin{homeworkProblem}
Consider Figure 2.12 , for which there is an institutional network connected to the Internet. Suppose that the average object size is 850,000 bits and that the average request rate from the
institution’s browsers to the origin servers is 16 requests per second. Also suppose that the amount of time it takes from when the router on the Internet side of the access link forwards an
HTTP request until it receives the response is three seconds on average (see Section 2.2.5). Model the total average response time as the sum of the average access delay (that is, the delay
from Internet router to institution router) and the average Internet delay. For the average access delay, use $\Delta / (1 - \Delta \beta)$, where $\Delta$ is the average time required to send an object over the access link and b is the arrival rate of objects to the access link.
    \begin{homeworkSection}{(a)}
        Find the total average response time. \\
        \problemAnswer{
            Time required = L/R = $\frac{850000}{15,000,000} = 0.0567s$ \\
            Traffic Intensity = $16 * 0.0567 = 0.907$ \\
            Therefore, average access delay = $\frac{0.0567}{1 - 0.907} = 0.6s$ \\
            The total average response time = $0.6 + 3 = 3.6s$
        }
    \end{homeworkSection}
    
    \begin{homeworkSection}{(b)}
        Now suppose a cache is installed in the institutional LAN. Suppose the miss rate is 0.4. Find the total response time. \\
        \problemAnswer{
            Average access delay = $\frac{\Delta}{1 - \beta \Delta} = \frac{0.0567}{1 - 0.4 * 16 * 0.0567} = 0.089$ \\
            Average response time from cache misses = 3 + 0.089 = 3.089s \\
            Total average response time is 0.6 * 0 + 0.4 * 3.089 = 1.24s \\
            Due to cache hit, response time is 0 and average response time is reduced from 3.6s to 1.24s.
        }
